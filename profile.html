  1.It always seems impossible until it's done<br> 2.The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling but in rising every time we fall <br>3.
  As I walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom I knew if I didn't leave my bitterness and hatred behind,I'd still be in prison <br>NOTE:
  All the lessons above,are of a few quotes, words given by Nelson Mandela while alive. May His Soul Rest in Peace.
